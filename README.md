# InternProject
Web application that allows users to study with the English words that they learned recently and want to practice with them and their meanings. Project’s features as follows:

-    Firstly user saves words that he/she want to practice with the application. The user needs to enter the word and its Turkish meaning while saving the word. Then the user can save the word with the save button. The user can enter one or more Turkish meaning to one word. If the user wants to enter more than one meaning, he/she needs to write them separated with the comma.
-    After the user save all the words he/she want to practice, he/she can start to exercise with them with the start exercise button.
-    Then application randomly selects a word from the list that created by the user and asks its Turkish meaning. The user has to give its meaning with the speech by using the microphone. The user must give at least one of the meanings he/she enter while the saving word. If the user doesn’t know the answer he/she can use voice commands such as “soruyu atla” or “pas geç”.
-    Then app shows if user answer question correctly or not. If the user prefers to pass the question he/she is considered to give the wrong answer. If the user gives at least one meaning correctly he/she considered giving the true answer.
-    The application continues with other words. One of the important features of this application is that it selects which question to ask. That means app need to ask wrongly answered words more frequently compared to correctly answered questions. At the same time recently added words also must be asked more frequently compared to old words.
